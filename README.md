# Towards Generative Adversarial Audio Synthesis via Latent Interpolation Between Desired Timbral Qualities

## Written by Sebastian Monzon

This is a demonstration of multiclass classification using a convolutional neural network model to predict musical instrument class names.

### About

- tensorflow multiclass model is trained via "train_multiclass.py"
- display model confusion matrix after training with "run_model.py"

### Prerequisites

- tensorflow
- seaborn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- audiomentations (optional)
